#Task:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

#Input:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

#Solution:
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast = slow = head
        for i in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
            
        if fast is None:
            return head.next
        
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
