#Task:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

#Input:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Input: head = []
Output: []

#Solution:
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
        prev = None
        curr = head
        next = None
        
        while curr:
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
            
            head = prev
            
        return head
